    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. It is a way to create user-defined data structures that encapsulate data and related functionality. A class serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or item that is created based on the class definition. An object has its own unique state (attribute values) and can perform actions (method invocations) defined by the class.\n"

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class. It enables the data to be accessed and manipulated only through the defined methods, providing data protection and abstraction. Encapsulation allows for better organization and modularization of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. It promotes code reuse and supports the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. A derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) can inherit and extend the properties and methods of a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways. It allows objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their specific class or type. Polymorphism enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner, promoting extensibility and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on capturing only the essential details and hiding unnecessary complexities from the user. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a set of common methods without providing implementation details. Abstraction provides a high-level view of objects and their interactions, promoting code readability and reducing code complexity."
